## Results

Here we can add figures, tables and results...

### Functional Group Cover vs Removed Biomass

```{r}
#| label: fig-fg-cover-biomass
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between functional group cover and removed biomass. Left panel shows graminoid cover vs removed biomass for plots where graminoids were removed. Right panel shows forb cover vs removed biomass for plots where forbs were removed. Regression lines with 95% confidence intervals are shown."
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Load the figure from targets
tar_load(fg_cover_biomass_panels)

# Display the figure
fg_cover_biomass_panels
```

### Model Coefficients and Interactions for Graminoid-only Plots

```{r}
#| label: fig-g-only-coeffs-interactions
#| fig-cap: "Model results for graminoid-only plots. (a) Estimated coefficients from the mixed model. (b) Predicted interaction effects between precipitation and crb_B."
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(sjPlot)
library(targets)

# Load the figures from targets
tar_load(G_only_coeffs)
tar_load(G_only_interactions)

# Combine the two plots and label as a and b
(G_only_coeffs + G_only_interactions) +
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'a')
